I am a postgraduate student graduated from [Beijing Institute of Technology (北京理工大学)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shuang Li](https://shuangli.xyz/). I received my Bachelor's degree (2019-2023) and Master's degree (2023-2025) in [School of Mathematics and Statistics from Beijing Institute of Technology (北京理工大学数学与统计学院)](https://math.bit.edu.cn/). 

My main research interests during my master's degree are in Dynamic Transfer Learning and Causal Learning. At this stage, I am mainly focusing on Multimodal Learning and Large Language Models.
