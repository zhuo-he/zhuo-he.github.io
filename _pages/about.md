I am a postgraduate student graduated from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shuang Li](https://shuangli.xyz/). I received my Bachelor's degree (2019-2023) and Master's degree (2023-2025) in School of Mathematics and Statistics from Beijing Institute of Technology.

At this stage, I am mainly focusing on multimodal learning and large language models.
